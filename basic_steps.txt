1. Create apps required -> py manage.py startapp [appname]
2. Move the apps into the project folder
3. Add the apps to the settings.py file INSTALLED_APPS
4. Create urls.py file in each app and set urlpatterns = ()
5. Add the paths of newly created files to main urls.py file using include('path_to_blog/', include('project.app.urls'))
6. In settings.py STATIC_URL = 'static/' -> indicates url in client
and set STATICFILES_DIRS = () to include the staticfiles resources -> indicated location in file system

Creating and adding VIEWS.
A view is a function or callable (functions, classes with __call__ overriden method) which has at least 1 param
'request' as minimum, and returns HTTP response as HttpResponse(content) with a content (could be simple text).
In order to visualize, we will return templates as HttpResponse using render() method. -> return render(request, 'template_name', context)
The context is {} and allows dynamic info to be passed to the template.

7. After creating the views using templates, add the urls to the app's urls.py file and always name the urls.
8. If you use parameter in the url, i.e <int:pk> then the same name of the param should be used in the view. Otherwise
will throw error
9. If you have same prefix for multiple urls, use include() to avoid repetition, ie
path('profile/<int:pk>', include([list_of_required_paths])

10. In the *.html files or templates, the css is loaded using href="static/.../..." by default since the default
static folder for client in settings.py is STATIC_URL = 'static/'. However, if we change this folder to be 'static2' ie
then the css will not be loaded. In order to avoid hardcoding the information, tag is used {% static 'rest_of_url' %} which
has to be loaded (imported) as {% load static %} on top of the html file. The tag ALWAYS point to the folder, indicated
by the STATIC_URL and this should be done in all .html files

11. In the *.html files must use {% url %} tag to indicate hyperlinks -> {% url 'name of the view' %}

12. The 404 page should be set if page not found. In settings DEBUG=FALSE. We should have ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost',]
